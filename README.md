Project Title - " Surface EMG Pattern Recognition for Hand Gestrures Based on Hierarchical Clustering" 

Team Members: Ernesto Hernandez and Chinonso Ovuegbe 

Final Project for 'Machine Learning and Data Analytics Class"

Summary: We used classification based models(KNN, K-means) to classify six gestures using raw Electromyography data from the UCI machine learning learning repository. Overall, our clustering model yielded an 84.3% accuracy

Hand gestures classified:

1 - Hand at rest

2- Hand clenched in a fist 

3- Wrist flexion 

4- Wrist extension 

5- Radial deviation 

6- Ulnar deviation
